wc24boottitle v1.0 by yellowstar6
This is a simple NAND title for use with WC24 title booting. This is a "hidden" 00010008 title, it will not appear in sysmenu. This title can boot software specified via NANDBOOTINFO. Depending on the NANDBOOTINFO parameters, software can be booted from either SD, HTTP, or official game discs via TinyLoad. NANDBOOTINFO launchcode value 1 is for homebrew booting, the path/URL is specified in NANDBOOTINFO argv[1]. NANDBOOTINFO launchcode value 2 boots the game disc, this takes no NANDBOOTINFO arguments. The low 24-bits of launchcode are used for specifying the type, the final high 8-bits are for booting options.
Before booting, NANDBOOTINFO launchcode is set to zero. When wc24boottitle is launched when NANDBOOTINFO launchcode is zero, or any other launchcode that isn't handled, the Wii is shutdown. When the installer finishes installing wc24boottitle, it launches wc24boottitle, which then shuts down the Wii since launchcode is zero. The installer has an option to delete wc24boottitle when it's detected. Since libyellhttp can only download to FAT, an SD card must be inserted when using HTTP booting. wc24boottitle doesn't support HTTP chunked-encoding, since libyellhttp doesn't support it. When launchcode bit 24 is set, WC24 is used to download the dol via HTTP instead of libyellhttp. WC24 downloads content to NAND, and should support chunked-encoding unlike libyellhttp. Content downloaded with WC24 must fit into the IOS heap, this heap is only several MBs. The entry and content stored on NAND for HTTP booting are deleted after the content is downloaded and read.
This title has the same TMD access_rights as HBC 1.0.7, which lets you still use DVD-access and disabled AHBPROT with homebrew booted with this, like HBC 1.0.7. The wc24boottitle titleID is 00010008-57434254.(00010008-WCBT) The installer reloads to IOS36. By default the installer ask whether you want to delete wc24boottitle if it's detected, and if you want to install wc24boottitle. When argv[1] value 1 is passed to the installer by wiiload, the installer will automatically install wc24boottitle. When argv[2] value 1 is passed to the installer by wiiload, the installer will automatically delete wc24boottitle if detected. Normally when deletion/installation fails, or when deletion and installation are skipped, you are asked to press the home button to exit. When either argv[1] or argv[2] are specified, the installer automatically exits where it asks you to press home to exit.
Wc24boottitle installs WC24 entries to auto-update itself. Currently this is LAN only. The installer app doesn't delete these entries when deleting wc24boottitle, KD will delete those entries when it's downloading the entries content and can't find wc24dl.vff. With the entries installed, WC24 downloads wc24boottitle updates hourly in the background, and wc24boottitle checks if there's an update available each time wc24boottitle is run. Wc24boottitle boots the installer dol downloaded by WC24 when an update is available. The auto-update entries URLs that wc24boottitle installs uses the same anonymous tracking info for logging server access as wc24app, like wc24app this info only contains the consoleID unique to each Wii.

Credits:
The Loadmii reload stub(which is based on the savezelda reload stub) is used for the boot and reload stub. This stub was modified to load from a path stored in MEM2 set by wc24boottitle. This stub was also modified to disable SD loading, for use with future HTTP loading.
Marcan's TinyLoad. This was modified to support loading GC disc games via BC, and the HBC titleID was adjusted when loading fails for HBC 1.0.7.
Bootmii ppcskel realmode.s for title realmode vector.
Bushing's patchmii-core for fakesigning code, title crypto code, etc
