Known wiinandfuse bugs:

1) With the -p option, permissions aren't set correctly in stbuf->st_mode.

2) Sometimes you may get error "read bytes out of range", etc, when opening files. You can work around this by re-mounting NAND: fusermount -u <nand.bin> wiinandfuse <nand.bin> <mountpoint> <options>
