1. WMB beacon checksum validation fails everytime, thus ignoring "invalid" checksum beacons must be disabled in the NDS version.

2. It may take a long time for the DS assembler to finish one capture.

3. The assembled .nds has a corrupted header, banner, and signature. There's icon data inside the header. The "banner"
contains only bebugging text, which should be in wmb_log.txt. This "banner" overwrites the signature.(Or the "signature"
may also have this debug text.)
