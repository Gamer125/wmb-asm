nzoneurlstacksmash v0.2 by yellowstar6. This is an Nintendo Zone/DS Station exploit. It hasn't been tested with Nintendo Zone yet. NetFront 3.3 used by DS Station has stack smash bugs in a function handling tag fields with URLs. Nintendo Zone v3.0 has this bug. This exploit can bootstrap an embedded .nds.

In order to use this exploit, a Linux/hostapd compatible box with a wireless NIC compatible with hostapd is required, to use it at home.(Patches need applied to hostapd in order for the Nintendo Zone client to connect the AP, it's unknown what beacon tags DSi sysmenu checks for.) BIND needs installed, to redirect DNS to your web server. An forwarder/proxy app for https is required, when running a web server with DNS redirection.(Such as httpsforwarder in wmb-asm SVN trunk.) The domain name that needs redirected and forwarded can be captured with Wireshark, etc. The SSID and WEP key from a real Nintendo Zone/DS Station AP is required.(The WEP key is generated from the SSID.)

This exploit works with any html sent over http. With Nintendo's DS Station server, this is mostly the *_up.html files, which are used for the main screen. With third-party companies, which have a link to their site on the Nintendo Zone index html, all html is sent over http as Nintendo won't sign third-party server certs with Nintendo's server CA. Third-party content is stored on third-party servers. It's unknown if there's still vulnerable html transferred with HTTP with the NZone server, the main screen index html now uses the same CGI HTTPS-only system as the sub-screen html. By default, this exploit generates htmlhaxx_x.html,(x is dsstation/nzone) which should replace the target html, for example dsds_menu_up.html retrieved by the client.(With a web server, the htmlhaxx html can be linked to from the target html, like dsds_menu_up.html.)
