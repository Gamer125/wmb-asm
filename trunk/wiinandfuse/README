wiinandfuse v1.0 by yellowstar6
Mount Wii NAND images and SFFS dumps with FUSE. wiinandfuse supports Bootmii dumps, raw NAND dumps with ECC and without ECC. SVN checkout command: svn co http://wmb-asm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiinandfuse/
wiinandfuse uses the MIT license.
wiinandfuse output when run without params:

Usage:
wiinandfuse <nand.bin> <mount point> <options>
Options:
-s: Dump contains only the 4MB SFFS. Reading files will do nothing, the data reading buffers will be cleared.
-k: Directory name of keys to use for raw NAND images. Default for keyname is "default". Path: $HOME/.wii/<keyname>
-p: Use NAND permissions. UID and GUI of objects will be set to the NAND UID/GID, as well as the permissions. This option only enables setting the UID/GID and permissions in stat, the open and readdir functions don't check permissions.

Features:
Read-only, writing is not supported. ECC correction is done for dumps with ECC. Usage of the UID/GID, and permissions from NAND is supported with the -p option. This doesn't restrict file access.
Supported FUSE fs functions:
statfs(statvfs)
getattr(stat)
readdir
open
release
read
