There is no known bugs for the Linux/Win32 versions.

Known NDS bugs:
The NDS version has the bugs from the Linux/Win32 versions if any, as well as:

1) CyaSSL doesn't even try connecting to server. Must be a flaw with porting/compiling CyaSSL for NDS.

2) Only the response line and the first response header is received, no additional headers or the actual content received. When the connection is closed by the server, dswifi recv may be returning zero before all the data received is processed/received by yellhttp.

Known Wii bugs:
The Wii version has the bugs from the Linux/Win32 versions if any, as well as:

1) A crash occurs when trying to use SSL. CyaSSL doesn't try connecting to the server before this crash, porting/compiling issue perhaps?
