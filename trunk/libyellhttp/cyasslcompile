Compiling CyaSSL(http://www.yassl.com/) for NDS:

./configure --host=arm-eabi --enable-singleThreaded --enable-debug --prefix=/opt/devkitpro/libnds CPPFLAGS="-L/pathto/devkitpro/libnds -I/pathto/devkitpro/libnds/include -DNO_WRITEV -DNDS -DARM9 -DOPENSSL_EXTRA"

Adjust cyassl_io.c includes for NDS sockets and wifi includes.
Tweak types.h and add a include for nds.h and add a ifndef NDS block around the byte typedef.

Compiling CyaSSL for Wii:
CyaSSL supports devkitpro for Wii, somewhat. You can find the configure command in the CyaSSL README. However you need to add these options to CPPFLAGS: -DNO_WRITEV -DOPENSSL_EXTRA With update-to-date devkitPPC you need to change the powerpc-gekko paths to powerpc-eabi.

Compiling the examples for NDS/Wii fails, that can be ignored.
On Win32 you can use configure by replacing ./configure with: sh configure
You'll need MinGW msys. The paths need to be unix style, forward slashes.(/c/devkitpro/ etc.)
For compiling on Linux/Win32, you need to add this option to the configure command: CPPFLAGS="-DOPENSSL_EXTRA".
