libyellhttp v1.0 by yellowstar6
libyellhttp is a small C HTTP client library. See yellhttptest for example on usage, as well as yellhttp.h.
Currently supported features:

1) Redirection is supported. It's possible with a optional user server_flag to disable automatic redirection.
2) libyellhttp sends the If-Modified-Since header if the download filename already exists locally. This can be disabled. Thus when a file was already downloaded, it is only downloaded if it was modified since it was downloaded.
3) Basic and digest authentication is supported.
4) Partial range downloading is supported. Automatically resuming is not supported, if the connection is lost libyellhttp will block indefinitely.
5) Support for more headers can be added with the YellHttp_SetHeaderCb function.
6) SSL is supported, with CyaSSL. Server certificate verification is disabled. This is mainly for compatibility with Nintendo servers, as well as other servers using self-signed certificates.
