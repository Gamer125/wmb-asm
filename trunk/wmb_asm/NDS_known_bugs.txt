1. WMB beacon checksum validation fails everytime, thus ignoring "invalid" checksum beacons must be disabled in the NDS version.

2. It may take a long time for the DS assembler to finish one capture.

3. ~72 bytes are pre-appended to the assembled Arm7 binary, causing RSA verification to fail, and white screens when attempting to boot.
