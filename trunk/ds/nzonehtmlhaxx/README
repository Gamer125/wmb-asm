nzonehtmlhaxx v0.2 by yellowstar6. This is an Nintendo Zone/DS Station exploit. NetFront 3.3 used by DS Station has a buffer overflow bug in a function parsing URLs. Nintendo Zone v3.0 has this bug. It's difficult to use this exploit with NZone since everything uses HTTPS. This exploit can bootstrap an embedded .nds. The default embedded .nds bootstraps hbmenu from the storage device, currently a flash card.

In order to use this exploit, a Linux/hostapd compatible box with a wireless NIC compatible with hostapd is required, to use it at home. BIND needs installed, to redirect DNS to your web server. An forwarder/proxy app for https is required, when running a web server with DNS redirection.(Such as httpsforwarder in wmb-asm SVN trunk.) The domain name that needs redirected and forwarded can be captured with Wireshark, etc. The SSID and WEP key if any from a real Nintendo Zone/DS Station AP is required.(The DS Station WEP key is generated from the SSID.)

This exploit works with any html sent over http. With Nintendo's DS Station server, this is mostly the *_up.html files, which are used for the main screen. NZone uses only HTTPS. By default, this exploit generates htmlhaxx_x.html,(x is dsstation/nzone) which should replace the target html, for example dsds_menu_up.html retrieved by the client.(With a web server, the htmlhaxx html can be linked to from the target html, like dsds_menu_up.html.)
